        <p class="history">
            &emsp; &emsp; The Yu-gi-oh franchise started out as a manga in 1996. It tells the adventure of Yugi Mutou
            who solved the ancient Millennium Puzzle, which lends him the spirit of a nameless Pharaoh. From then,
            whenever Yugi or his friends encounter dangers, the spirit challenges the opposition to a Shadow Game that
            reveals one's heart. As the story progresses, Yugi and his friends venture through dangers to help the
            Pharaoh regains his memory and his true name.
            <br> <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; Yu-gi-oh card game have been around since 1999 in Japan and 2002 in North America. The game
            features thousands of cards, several archetypes, and an endless number of combo combinations. It involves 2
            players, each has a main deck (40-60 cards) and an extra deck (max 15 cards). Each side of the field has 5
            monster slots and 5 trap/spell slots, a field spell slot, a graveyard slot and 2 shared extra deck slots.
            The game has 2 different rulings: Trading Card Game (TCG) and Original Card Game (OCG), with TCG referring
            to North America and OCG referring to Japan. Having different rulings and regulations, the dynamics of each
            focuses on different aspects of the game.

                    <b> Monster Card </b>
                    <br> <br>
                    &emsp; &emsp; Monster card is the main damage dealer in the game. There are several types of monster
                    cards (regular cards, XYZ cards, Link cards, Synchro cards, etc). Each card has a name at the top,
                    an element on the right of it, a level (amount of stars) below, an artwork, and types, effects,
                    attack, defense below. When played, a monster card can be in either attack (placed vertical) or
                    defense (placed horizontally) position. When first plays, if the card is in attack position, it must
                    be facing up, and if in defense position then facing down. When destroyed, it will be moved to
                    graveyard.</p>

                    text [Spell Card] instead, and does not have attack or defense stats. Spell card can be played
                    immediately from hand or set on the field on the back row of the monster slots. If the card is a
                    field spell, however, it will be placed on the field spell zone. Each player can have only 1 field
                    spell on the board. In addition, spell card is colored in teal. When destroyed, it will be moved to
